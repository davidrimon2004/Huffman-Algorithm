# Huffman-Algorithm
Using Huffman's algorithm and tree to compress images put in a local text file to convert it into text first before compressing it and then creating a new compressed version
The file named Phase 2 works only on text files and doesn't compress photos
"Compress" file processes photos and compresses them by a few bytes 
⚠️Note: don't forget to adjust the paths of the files according to your device ⚠️
